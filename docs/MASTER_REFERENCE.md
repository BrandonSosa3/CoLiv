# CoLiv OS - Master Reference Document
**Last Updated:** October 13, 2025  
**Status:** MVP Complete + Tenant Portal - Frontend & Backend 100% Functional

---

in this video I’ll be walking you through a project I built called CoLiv, a co-living operations platform designed for small property operators.

CoLiv is built to simplify room-level management — unlike most property management tools that stop at the unit level, this one tracks everything down to the individual room. That means each room can have its own pricing, size, and tenant profile, giving operators full visibility and flexibility across their properties.
In this walkthrough, I’ll show how the system works from both the admin and tenant perspectives, including property setup, room tracking, and tenant interactions.”
I have also began implementing an ai algorithm which is going to be a roommate matcher for people who are interested in picking a roommate who is random but still compatible with their lifestyle.

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**What:** Co-living operations software with room-level management + Tenant Portal  
**Key Differentiator:** Room-level tracking with individual pricing (Property → Unit → Room → Tenant)  
**Target:** Small co-living operators (1-10 properties)  
**Pricing:** $99/mo per property

## KEY ARCHITECTURE

### Core Differentiator:
**Room-level tracking** (not just unit-level)

**Traditional PM Software:**  
Property → Unit → Tenant

**CoLiv OS:**  
Property → Unit → **Room** → Tenant

### Dual Portal System:
**Operator Portal (Port 5173):**
- Full property/unit/room management
- Tenant assignment and management
- Payments tracking and marking paid
- Maintenance request management
- Announcements creation

**Tenant Portal (Port 5174):**
- View lease information
- View payment history
- Submit maintenance requests
- View property announcements
- Separate authentication system

### Why This Matters:
- Each room has individual rent amount
- Multiple tenants per unit with different lease dates
- Automatic payment generation per tenant
- Better occupancy tracking
- Supports flexible, staggered leases
- Tenants have their own portal for self-service

---

## DATABASE SCHEMA

**Hierarchy:**
operators (1:Many) → properties (1:Many) → units (1:Many) → rooms (1:1) → tenants
↓
payments
maintenance_requests
announcements

**Core Tables (All Implemented):**
- users (operators & tenants with roles)
- operators
- properties
- units
- **rooms** ◄── KEY DIFFERENTIATOR
- tenants (linked to users)
- payments (auto-generated on tenant assignment)
- maintenance_requests
- announcements

## WORKING EXAMPLE
Property: Downtown Loft (San Diego, CA)
└── Unit 3B (4 bedrooms, 2 bath, 1500 sq ft)
├── Room A: $900/mo → tenant1@test.com (occupied) ✅ Payment: $900 pending
├── Room B: $750/mo → tenant2@test.com (occupied) ✅ Payment: $750 pending
├── Room C: $800/mo → tenant3@test.com (occupied) ✅ Payment: $800 pending
└── Room D: $800/mo → tenant4@test.com (occupied) ✅ Payment: $800 pending
Operator Portal (5173):

See all 4 rooms with occupancy status
Mark payments as paid
Create maintenance requests
Post announcements
Total monthly revenue: $3,250

Tenant Portal (5174):

tenant1@test.com logs in → sees Room A, Unit 3B
Views lease dates and $900/mo rent
Sees payment history
Can submit maintenance requests
Views property announcements


**This dual-portal system with room-level pricing is impossible with traditional property management software.**

IMPORTANT NOTES
Tenant Account Creation:

When assigning a tenant in the operator portal, a user account is automatically created
Default password: "TempPassword123!" (can be customized in the form)
Tenant uses email + password to login to tenant portal (port 5174)
First payment is auto-generated on assignment

Authentication:

Operators and tenants use the same login endpoint but different portals
JWT token contains user.id (not email)
Operators have separate token storage from tenants
Protected routes verify user role

Database Cleanup:

Database Cleanup Script - clean_all.sh

cd backend
./scripts/clean_all.sh

What Is Preserved
